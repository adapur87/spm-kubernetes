## What is CRC?

CodeReady Containers (CRC) is a minimal, preconfigured OpenShift 4.1 or newer cluster that is designed to run on your local workstation as a development environment for OpenShift.
For more information, see [CodeReady Containers](https://github.com/code-ready/crc).

Similar to Minikube in concept, CRC provides a cloud like environment locally to create and deploy an OpenShift cluster for development and testing purposes.

This page covers some common CRC operations, including deploying IBM® Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) to the CRC environment. You will use the helm charts produced in [Preparing Helm charts](/deployment/hc_deployment).

For a full getting started guide for CRC, see [Getting Started Guide CodeReady Containers](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.8/html/getting_started_guide/index)

### Minimum System requirements

CodeReady Containers system requirements can be found here: [CRC Minimum system requirements](https://code-ready.github.io/crc/#minimum-system-requirements_gsg).

<InlineNotification>

There is a know CRC [issue](https://github.com/code-ready/crc/issues/557) with respect to resource usage. When deploying SPM on CRC our experience has shown that a minimum of 16GB will improve performance, however 32GB is optimal.

## Installing CRC

Create an account at [RedHat Cloud](https://www.redhat.com/).
Create a `$CRC_HOME` folder to use for the purposes of the installation.
Download the installation archive from [latest release](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned) to `$CRC_HOME` and extract the archive.
On the same page, download your pull secret to `$CRC_HOME`. At the time of writing the `latest release` is `1.13.0`.

```shell
tar -xvf crc-macos-amd64.tar.xz
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  You have two options, add the binary to the `PATH` environment variable, or move it to `/usr/local/bin/`.

</InlineNotification>

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Add to the PATH">
<Row>
<Column>

```shell
export PATH=$CRC_HOME/crc-macos-1.10.0-amd64:$PATH`
```

</Column>
</Row>
</Tab>

<Tab label="/usr/bin/local ">
<Row>
<Column>

```shell
mv $CRC_HOME/crc-macos-1.10.0-amd64/crc /usr/local/bin
```

</Column>
</Row>
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Whichever option you choose, you should now have crc in your executable path, to test this run the following command:

```shell
crc version
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```
crc version: 1.10.0+9025021
OpenShift version: 4.4.3 (embedded in binary)
```

## Setting up CRC

The first step is to configure the prerequisites for the OpenShift cluster, including taking control of your hosts and resolver files to provide access to the CRC cluster.
To do this run the following command, providing the workstation administrator password as required.
This procedure also creates the ~/.crc directory if it does not already exist.

```shell
crc setup
```

Now that the basic configuration is complete, you need to edit the configuration to change the memory limit and add the path to the pull secret file downloaded previously.

To change the memory limit, set the CPUs to 6, and add the path to the pull secret file downloaded previously. Run the following commands:

```shell
crc config set memory 32768
crc config set cpus 6
crc config set pull-secret-file $CRC_HOME/pull-secret.txt
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  While CRC's minimum memory allocation requirement is 8GB, only a single replica SPM deployment can be achieved using this.

You should allocate as many resources as are available.

The greater the workload the greater the memory and processor requirements.

Any changes to the crc config require you to delete the cluster and start a new one.

</InlineNotification>

You can always check the configured options of ’crc’, run the following command:

```shell
crc config view
```

After setup is complete, start the cluster with 6 CPUs, run the following command:

```shell
crc start
```

This outputs something similar to the following:

```
level=info msg="Checking if oc binary is cached"
...
...
...
level=info msg="To access the cluster, first set up your environment by following 'crc oc-env' instructions"
level=info msg="Then you can access it by running 'oc login -u developer -p developer https://api.crc.testing:6443'"
level=info msg="To login as an admin, run 'oc login -u kubeadmin -p YourPassWordHere https://api.crc.testing:6443'"
...
...
```

Note the `kubeadmin` and `developer` credentials for later use.

<InlineNotification>

**Note:**  For the rest of the guide you can substitute the credentials you received when you started your cluster for `$KUBEADMN_PSWD` and `$KUBEDEVEL_PSWD`.

Alternatively, these credentials are returned by the `crc console --credentials` command.
This guide uses `$KUBEDEVEL_PSWD` and `$KUBEADMN_PSWD` environment variables.

You may find it convenient to to the same, so you can copy and paste commands without having to switch values:

`export KUBEADMN_PSWD=yourKubeAdminPassword`

`export KUBEDEVEL_PSWD=yourKubeDeveloperPassword`

</InlineNotification>

Next, set up the OpenShift Client `oc`, which is used to administer the CRC cluster:

```shell
crc oc-env
eval $(crc oc-env)
```

If required you can stop the cluster:

```shell
crc stop
```

Or delete the cluster:

```shell
crc delete
```

## Creating a CRC project

Create a project for the SPM deployment, again use an environment variable for your convenience when following the guide.

Create the environment variable, you can set to value to anything you like, but it should consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or `-`, and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. `my-name`,  or `123-abc`):

```shell
export PROJECT="ocp"
```

Log in as kubeadmin:

```shell
oc login -u kubeadmin -p $KUBEADMN_PSWD https://api.crc.testing:6443
```

Create the project:

```shell
oc adm new-project $PROJECT
```

Switch kubernetes context to the new project:

```shell
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace $PROJECT
```

## Deployment Process

Enable the Image Registry default route:

```shell
oc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster --type merge -p '{"spec":{"defaultRoute":true}}'

```

Add relevant roles to user:

```shell
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user registry-viewer kube:admin
```

Log in to the OpenShift registry:

```shell
docker login -u kubeadmin -p $(oc whoami -t) $(oc registry info --public)
```

<InlineNotification>

`oc registry info --public` should return a URL like `default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps-crc.testing` which is used for publishing images into the internal image registry.

The image registry URL for use in Helm override values can be retrieved using `oc registry info --internal`: `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000`

## Hostname configuration for CRC

This runbook uses a generic hostname of `spm-ocp.apps-crc.testing` as an example in commands and the configuration files.
You should add the CRC IP address to the `hosts` file by using the generic hostname, or else modify the usage of `spm-ocp.apps-crc.testing` in this runbook to reflect your local hostname.
